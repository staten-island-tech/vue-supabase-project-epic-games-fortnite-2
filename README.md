Vue 3 with SQL: You will be using Vue 3 with Supabase to create a web application
that can Create, Read, Update and Delete data from a Supabase database. You will
also include authentication into the application. You will need Pinia for this project in
order to manage “State”

Authenticated Routes and Hiding
Sensitive Data: Sensitive data is hidden
behind authenticated routes. To
demonstrate mastery students must
ensure sensitive data is not sent back to
the user unless necessary
SQL Models: Data models are created
with appropriate schema. At least 1 model
has ties to foreign fields.
SQL Joins and Aggregations: At least 1
route uses data joined between 2 tables.
At least 1 example of data aggregation
from at least 1 table
State Management: Pinia is used to
manage the state of the application
(authentication status,data persists
between routes
Version Control: Effective use of version
control using Git and Git branches.
Students demonstrate mastery by
effectively using git branches, including a
production branch, development branch,
and separate branches for features/users
Computed Properties: Computed
properties are used IF necessary to
display data
Props: Props are passed from parent to

child to display data
Array Methods: Project properly utilizes
array methods for iteration/displaying data
Promise Handling: rejected promises
receive proper error handling alerting the
user to why a request failed. Fulfilled
promises result in data being displayed in
the HTML as requested
Form Handling: search functionality is
handled with logic to prevent blank fields.
Forms are used to get data from an API
Vue Router: Multiple routes are configured
for components. Bonus for using parameters
in the routes
Accessibility: use of semantic HTML,
appropriate contrast, passes WAVE
Communication: Students can clearly
communicate and explain their understanding
of their functions and how their project works
